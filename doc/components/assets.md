# Assets
Assets are the entities that populate AnyBase. Every Asset is defined by its [AssetType]. To manager the assets available, there is the asset manager, which provides the database interface to store, edit and get assets. Assets basically consist of nothing more than an id and a dataset. The dataset is a mapping, containing a value for each of the columns/fields defined by the assets asset type. The type of the data contained in each of the fields is defined by the datatype of the corresponding column. The database representation is completely generic, except for the primary key of the asset. The id is autogenerated by the database and the asset_id field is filled from it.
