# Assets

Assets are the entities that populate AnyBase. Every Asset is defined by its [AssetType].
To manage the assets available, there is the asset manager, which provides the database
interface to store, edit and get assets. Assets basically consist of nothing more than
an id and a dataset. The dataset is a mapping, containing a value for each of the columns/fields
defined by the assets asset type. The type of the data contained in each of the fields is 
defined by the datatype of the corresponding [Column]. The database representation is completely
generic, except for the primary key of the asset. The id is autogenerated by the database and
the ``asset_id`` field is filled from it.
